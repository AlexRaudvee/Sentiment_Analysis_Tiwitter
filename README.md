# Sentiment Analysis on Twitter 

This challenge revolves around the question of how we compare the performance of airlines when they use Twitter as a communication channel. The dataset we are analyzing consists of a large number of tweets from several airlines, and we asked, in a role-playing game, to analyze the data for one of our clients. Our client is one out of several possible airlines, and in this project, the assigned airline is interested in assessing their performance when using Twitter as a communication channel. They are interested in comparing their performance to other airlines in general and an assigned competitor airline in particular. Our airline will be represented by an airline marketeer. The marketeer wonders whether their Twitter team is doing a good job and whether this is useful for the company, particularly in comparison to the competitor airline.

Our client is EasyJet company 

Our competitor is British Airways

## Learning Goals of this project

- independently apply and follow established data science research methods for a given problem and dataset,
- access, process, and reason about a large, complex dataset given in various data formats,
- independently find and familiarize themselves with programming languages, libraries, programs, and software packages for a specific purpose,
- implement a repeatable data analysis that makes use of existing libraries and programs in a self-chosen technical environment,
- independently validate results of their own and other studentâ€™s analyses using scientific techniques,
- solve a large data science task in a larger group of 6 students, and present their analysis and their findings in a presentation/poster suitable for a given audience.
